description: Analyze GitHub issues (bugs or feature requests)
---

1. **Read the issue**
   - Read the issue in full, including all comments and linked issues/PRs.

2. **Run Analysis (For bugs)**
   - Ignore any root cause analysis in the issue (likely wrong).
   - Read all related code files in full.
   - Trace the code path and identify the actual root cause.
   - Propose a fix.

3. **Run Analysis (For feature requests)**
   - Read all related code files in full.
   - Propose the most concise implementation approach.
   - List affected files and changes needed.

Do NOT implement unless explicitly asked. Analyze and propose only.
